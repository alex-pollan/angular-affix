        Tupacsum Ipsum And dreams of a world with the two of them are together, whatever. As long as when the check came they got first dibs. There was no mercy on the streets, I couldn't rest. Now ain't nobody tell us it was fair. it ain't no hope for tha future.
Suspended from school; and scared to go home, I was a fool. No money no babysitter, she couldn't keep a job. I wonder why we take from our women.
And dreams of a world with the two of them are together, whatever. Brenda got herself a boyfriend. But, Brenda's barely got a brain. Cause I bet Brenda doesn't even know. I blame my mother, for turning my brother into a crack baby.
And even though you're fed up. Suspended from school; and scared to go home, I was a fool. Call on the sirens, seen him murdered in the streets. From havin the world on his shoulders.
I was given this world I didn't make it. I reminice on the stress I caused, it was hell. As long as when the check came they got first dibs. Left me alone I grew up amongst a dyin breed.
We ain't meant to survive, cause it's a setup. Wonder why as I walk by. And dreams of a world with the two of them are together, whatever. I'm trapped inside a maze.
